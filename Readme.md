# Easy MLFlow

This mini project was created in order to try MLFlow as **quickly** and **easily** as possible. For the task, let's take the standard Titanic dataset

All you need is:
1. Install dependencies.

`pip install requirements.txt`

2. Run the mlflow server in console.

`mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080`

3. Run the code cells in the *main.ipynb*.

4. Go to the server `http://127.0.0.1:8080` and analyze your experiments. 


**MLFlow** is an open source platform designed to manage the complete machine learning lifecycle. In this code we will use it to track experiments.

In the future, I plan to take on a more complex task and add tf_idf and bert.
